# amex-jest-preset

An opinionated [Jest preset](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#preset-string)

For a React specific Jest preset use: [amex-jest-preset-react](https://github.com/americanexpress/amex-jest-preset-react) which extends off of this preset and adds some React specific configurations.

## Configurations

- [cacheDirectory](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#cachedirectory-string) is used to let Jest know to output its cache within the project workspace (specifically in `<rootDir>/.jest-cache`). This is useful as it eliminates issues caused by several projects sharing the same Jest cache on CI builds.

- [collectCoverage](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoverage-boolean) tells Jest to collect code coverage metrics on every test run

- [collectCoverageFrom](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoveragefrom-array) tells Jest what directories to collect and not collect coverage metrics from

- [coverageDirectory](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragedirectory-string) tells Jest to output the coverage reports into the `./test-results/coverage` directory

- [coverageReporters](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragereporters-array-string) tells Jest to report coverage as `text` which outputs to your console, `cobertura` format which Jenkins uses, and `lcov` which produces the pretty HTML you are all used to seeing from Istanbul

- [coverageThreshold](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragethreshold-object) tells Jest to return failure unless code coverage is 100% for branch, function, line, and statement. (Yes this does mean that your build will fail if you don't have 100% code coverage)

- [modulePathIgnorePatterns](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#modulepathignorepatterns-array-string) tells Jest to not even consider `npm-cache` and `npm` directories for module loading. This prevents issues on CI server where `npm-cache` may be shared across build workspaces.

- [testEnvironment](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#testenvironment-string) tells Jest to use `node` as its test environment. This is done for performance reasons as the full `jsdom` environment is not needed for most tests and including it slows Jest startup time considerably.

- [testResultsProcessor](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#testresultsprocessor-string) is used to output test results onto our HTML report creator. That way pretty HTML test results are created in `<rootDir>/test-results/`


## Usage

1. Install:
```bash
npm install --save-dev amex-jest-preset
```

2. And in your [Jest configuration][]:
```json
{
  "preset": "amex-jest-preset"
}
```
And... that's it! You now have all the boilerplate Jest configurations set up for you! Running `jest` from your `npm test` script will use all these configurations!

### Extending the preset provided configuration

You can add on and/or override any values provided in this preset as you wish in your [Jest configuration][].
